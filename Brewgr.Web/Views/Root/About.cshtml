            <p>
                Brewgr was originally created by Jason Zimmerman and Matthew Marksbury in 2011. As homebrewers we were amazed at the lack of cloud based tooling for homebrew recipes. We decided to build a simple homebrewing website and community that is easy to use and empowers homebrewers to become better at making great tasting homebrew. If you ever have feedback or need assistance please send an email to <a href="mailto:brewgr@brewgr.com">brewgr@brewgr.com</a> and we will try to get back to you ASAP.

            We believe there should exist an all purpose homebrewing website and community to help homebrewers make great beer.
            The homebrewing website and community should be easy to use and it should empower homebrewers to become better at making great tasting homebrew.
        </p>
        <p>
            The homebrewing website and community should be free and it should stay that way forever. Homebrewers already spend enough money on equipment and ingredients. They shouldn't have
            to fork out any more money to manage the homebrew process. They also shouldn't have to worry about getting invested in a homebrewing tool and end up getting charged
            once they've added all of their homebrew recipes.
        </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, we believe that the homebrewing website and community should be available from any Internet connected computer or mobile device. Homebrewers shouldn't have to worry about backing up their recipe databases or installing homebrew software on their computers.
